# What is the ideia on the questions

## Problem 01 and 02

to change the order of elements of an array in memory given a condition you can use a pointer to keep track to which element index
you are looking, and then compare the elements with the given condition

## Problem 06

if you need to keep track of data you can use hash map it is O(1) to find data in it

## Problem 08 and 09

with linked list remeber you can use a pointer to point always to the next element (this would be the tail)
and then you can add elements to the next of the pointer and then update the pointer to be the next element (the last element, the tail)
